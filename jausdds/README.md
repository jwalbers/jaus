The jausdds repository contains open source tools and resources for use with the SAE AS-4 JAUS standard.

The standard is available for purchase from SAE International via the link provided here:

Tools currently include:

src/parser: Parse DDS IDL to confirm correct operation of the JSIDL to IDL translator.
src/pygments:  Produce readable, colored IDL and XML for documentation.
src/translator:  Translate JSIDL into DDS IDL.
